This repo treats about 3 themes:

1. Audio Recognition
2. Video Recognition
3. Image Retrieval

Several different notebook were devoloped with respect to the project phases. In particular you will find:

-[Media Collection](https://github.com/RaffaeleAns/DSIM/blob/master/Codes/Media%20Collection.ipynb): script for audio and faces collection. The faces are cropped before saving the images.

-[Recordings Recognition](https://github.com/RaffaeleAns/DSIM/blob/master/Codes/Recordings%20Recognition.ipynb): Feed-forward Neural Net for speaker and word recognition. 

-[Face Recognition](https://github.com/RaffaeleAns/DSIM/blob/master/Codes/Face%20Recognition.ipynb): VGG16 CNN fine tuning for Face Recognition.

-[Image Retrieval](https://github.com/RaffaeleAns/DSIM/blob/master/Codes/Image%20Retrieval.ipynb): Most similar VIPs faces are returned from one picture.

-[Demo Live](https://github.com/RaffaeleAns/DSIM/blob/master/Codes/Demo%20Live.ipynb): Live Demo with OpenCV2.
